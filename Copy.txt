Name: Aman Kumar
Learning Track: DevOps – Azure Cloud Fundamentals
Topics Covered: Cloud Basics, Cloud Types, Cloud Service Models, Azure Datacenters, and Availability Zones


---

1. Objective of the Day

To understand the fundamentals of cloud computing, types of cloud deployment, service models, and how Microsoft Azure structures its global infrastructure for high availability and scalability.


---

2. Topics Covered

A. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing delivers computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet.

Offers flexibility, cost efficiency, and scalability without owning physical hardware.



---

B. Types of Cloud Deployment


---

C. Cloud Service Models


---

D. What is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform offering over 200 products and services for:

Compute, Networking, Storage

Machine Learning, DevOps, Containers

Identity, Databases, IoT, and Security




---

E. Azure Datacenters and Infrastructure

Datacenters

Azure has a global network of datacenters hosting its cloud infrastructure.

Each region consists of one or more datacenters, with high security and disaster recovery protocols.


Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a specific geographical area.

Azure has 60+ regions worldwide.



---

F. Availability Zones (AZs)

What is an Availability Zone?

An Availability Zone is a physically separate datacenter within an Azure region.

Designed for high availability and fault tolerance.


Purpose of AZs

Protect against hardware, software, and power failures.

Ensure 99.99% availability when apps are distributed across zones.

G. Summary Table


---

3. Activities Done

Theoretical study of:

Cloud types and service models

Azure’s infrastructure and high availability mechanisms


Referred to Microsoft Learn, official documentation, and visual guides.



---

4. Learnings & Takeaways

Cloud adoption reduces cost and improves agility.

Choosing the right service model (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) depends on project needs.

Azure’s availability zones play a crucial role in building resilient applications.



---

5. Plan for Next Day

Explore the Azure Portal.

Deploy a basic IaaS resource (Virtual Machine).
