Topic Covered: Creating a Freestyle Job in Jenkins

1. Objective of the Day

To learn how to create, configure, and run a Freestyle job in Jenkins to automate simple tasks like build, test, and deploy.


---

2. Topics Covered in Detail

A. What is a Freestyle Job?

A Freestyle Job is a simple, flexible project type in Jenkins.

It allows developers to configure and automate different tasks such as building code, running tests, or deploying applications without writing a lot of scripts.

Ideal for basic CI/CD pipelines or single-step tasks.

B. Steps to Create a Freestyle Job in Jenkins

1. Login to Jenkins Dashboard

Open Jenkins in your browser.



2. Create a New Job

Click on “New Item”.

Enter a project name (e.g., First-Freestyle-Job).

Select “Freestyle project” and click OK.



3. Configure Job

Description: Write what the job will do.

Source Code Management (SCM): If code is stored in Git, configure the repository URL.

Build Triggers: Set conditions like "Build periodically" or "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub."

Build Steps: Add steps like:

Execute shell script

Execute Windows batch command

Invoke Maven/Gradle if needed




4. Example Shell Command

echo "Hello, Jenkins!"


5. Post-build Actions

Actions after build like sending email notifications, archiving artifacts, publishing test reports, etc.



6. Save and Build

Click on Save.

Click Build Now to run the job.

Monitor output through Console Output.

3. Activities Done

Installed and launched Jenkins on localhost

Created a basic Freestyle job to print "Hello, Jenkins!"

Configured a job to clone a GitHub repo and display the README

Tested manual and triggered builds

Analyzed console output for successful build execution



---

4. Challenges Faced

Faced initial permission issues while Jenkins tried to pull GitHub code — resolved by setting credentials.

Forgot to configure build triggers properly during first try.

Misunderstood "Build Periodically" cron syntax — revised with examples.



---

5. Learnings & Takeaways

Freestyle jobs are good for quick automation without pipelines.

SCM configuration and build steps are critical parts of job setup.

Console Output is very helpful in debugging build failures.

Job configurations can be cloned to create multiple similar jobs quickly.
