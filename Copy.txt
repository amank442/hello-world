Subject: Topics I’m Excited to Learn in the Upcoming Linux Session

Hi Team,

As we get ready for the upcoming Linux session, I wanted to share the topics I’m particularly looking forward to diving deeper into. I believe these will greatly enhance my day-to-day DevOps work:

Linux file system structure and essential commands

User and group management with permissions

Process management and monitoring (ps, top, htop, kill, etc.)

Package management (apt, yum, dnf)

Bash scripting for automation

Disk usage analysis, partitioning, and mounting

Log management using journalctl, /var/log, and rotation

Networking tools and troubleshooting (netstat, ss, ip, ping, traceroute)

Useful text processing tools: grep, awk, sed

Linux security basics (file permissions, firewall, SELinux/AppArmor)


I’m eager to strengthen my Linux foundation and improve troubleshooting skills for real-world scenarios. Looking forward to learning together!

Best regards,
Aman
